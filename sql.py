## Challenge 1 - Who Have Published What At Where?
In this challenge you will write a MySQL `SELECT` query that joins various tables to figure out what titles each author has published at which publishers. Your output should have at least the following columns:
- `AUTHOR ID` - the ID of the author
- `LAST NAME` - author last name
- `FIRST NAME` - author first name
- `TITLE` - name of the published title
- `PUBLISHER` - name of the publisher where the title was published
## ANSWER ## 
SELECT 
    authors.au_id AS 'AUTHOR ID', 
    authors.au_lname AS 'LAST NAME', 
    authors.au_fname AS 'FIRST NAME', 
    titles.title AS 'TITLE', 
    publishers.pub_name AS 'PUBLISHER'
FROM 
    authors
JOIN titleauthor ON authors.au_id = titleauthor.au_id
JOIN titles ON titleauthor.title_id = titles.title_id
JOIN publishers ON titles.pub_id = publishers.pub_id;
## Challenge 2 - Who Have Published How Many At Where?
Elevating from your solution in Challenge 1, query how many titles each author has published at each publisher. Your output should look something like below:
## ANSWER ## 
SELECT 
    authors.au_id AS 'AUTHOR ID', 
    authors.au_lname AS 'LAST NAME', 
    authors.au_fname AS 'FIRST NAME', 
    publishers.pub_name AS 'PUBLISHER',
    COUNT(titles.title_id) AS 'NUMBER OF TITLES'
FROM 
    authors
JOIN titleauthor ON authors.au_id = titleauthor.au_id
JOIN titles ON titleauthor.title_id = titles.title_id
JOIN publishers ON titles.pub_id = publishers.pub_id
GROUP BY 
    authors.au_id, 
    authors.au_lname, 
    authors.au_fname, 
    publishers.pub_name;
## Challenge 3 - Best Selling Authors
Who are the top 3 authors who have sold the highest number of titles? Write a query to find out.
Requirements:
- Your output should have the following columns:
  - `AUTHOR ID` - the ID of the author
  - `LAST NAME` - author last name
  - `FIRST NAME` - author first name
  - `TOTAL` - total number of titles sold from this author
- Your output should be ordered based on `TOTAL` from high to low.
- Only output the top 3 best selling authors.
## ANSWER ## 
SELECT 
    authors.au_id AS 'AUTHOR ID', 
    authors.au_lname AS 'LAST NAME', 
    authors.au_fname AS 'FIRST NAME', 
    SUM(sales.qty) AS 'TOTAL'
FROM 
    authors
JOIN titleauthor ON authors.au_id = titleauthor.au_id
JOIN titles ON titleauthor.title_id = titles.title_id
JOIN sales ON titles.title_id = sales.title_id
GROUP BY 
    authors.au_id, 
    authors.au_lname, 
    authors.au_fname
ORDER BY 
    TOTAL DESC
LIMIT 3;
## Challenge 4 - Best Selling Authors Ranking
Now modify your solution in Challenge 3 so that the output will display all 23 authors instead of the top 3. Note that the authors who have sold 0 titles should also appear in your output (ideally display `0` instead of `NULL` as the `TOTAL`). Also order your results based on `TOTAL` from high to low.
## ANSWER ## 
SELECT 
    authors.au_id AS 'AUTHOR ID', 
    authors.au_lname AS 'LAST NAME', 
    authors.au_fname AS 'FIRST NAME', 
    IFNULL(SUM(sales.qty), 0) AS 'TOTAL'
FROM 
    authors
LEFT JOIN titleauthor ON authors.au_id = titleauthor.au_id
LEFT JOIN titles ON titleauthor.title_id = titles.title_id
LEFT JOIN sales ON titles.title_id = sales.title_id
GROUP BY 
    authors.au_id, 
    authors.au_lname, 
    authors.au_fname
ORDER BY 
    TOTAL DESC;
